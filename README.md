# Intro

BMCap is a message board application. It's designed to be a retirement present for Ms. Moy. She has
been teaching Boston Public school for 30 years. This app is for her past students, friends, and family
to leave messages for her to reach. It will be presented to her when she retires in June 2017.

## Overview & Planning

I created a message board for friends, family and students to communicate with client.

After the idea, I created the ERD layout and followed the relationships to build out my tables for the database.
Because this was a new framework and I have never used any framworks before, I studied previous lessons and
Ember documentation before I started.  I created a google form to gather data first from people while, and
it was a good blue print of how I wanted data to be received.  I build the API first to make sure the back-End
was sound so I can focus most of my time on the front-end.

## Future Iterations

On next update, re-define the form with new attributes and add-ons.<br>
Add drop down menu for year.
Add comment section on each post.
